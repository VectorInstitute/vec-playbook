# Getting Started With Vector Compute

The Vector Institute offers a wide variety of compute resources to our research community. This Getting Started guide offers a variety of instructions, examples and recipes to help you get up and running.

This guide is particularly focused on the new **Killarney** cluster. The Digital Research Alliance of Canada hosts a [Killarney documentation page](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Killarney) that covers some basics about the cluster and getting access. In this guide, we focus more on real user workflows, with a focus on providing examples that can easily be modified to fit your needs.

## Contents

 - [**Introduction to Vector Compute**](./introduction-to-vector-compute/): All the basics about connecting to the Killarney cluster, file systems, software environments, the Slurm job scheduler, and instructions for migrating your data from the legacy Bon Echo (Vaughan) cluster.
 - [**Slurm Examples**](./slurm-examples): A collection of Slurm scripts showing how to claim compute resources in various different configurations, how to use Slurm for basic training jobs, and how to use it to run cluster-based services like VS Code Server and Jupyter.
