# vec-playbook

Starter repository for researchers at Vector Institute to get started with Bon Echo and Killarney clusters.

This repo provides:
- **Getting Started docs** with introductions to using Vector compute clusters.
- **Templates** with ready-to-run Hydra + Submitit examples for ML training jobs.


## Getting started

See [getting-started](./getting-started) for documentation on using Vector compute resources.

## Templates

See [templates](./templates) for training templates that use Hydra + Submitit to structure experiments.

- Code lives under: [templates/src](./templates/src)
- Cluster configs live under: [templates/configs](./templates/configs)

Follow the setup and run instructions in [templates/README.md](./templates/README.md).
